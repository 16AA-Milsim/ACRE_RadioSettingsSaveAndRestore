# ACRE_RadioSettingsSaveAndRestore
ARMA3 - ACE Self Interaction scripts to Save and Restore ACRE2 Radio Settings between sessions.
(This mission is using the Virtual Reality map.)

You can access the fuctions via ACE Self Interaction -> Radios -> Radio Settings. Instructions are found there as well.

In order to use with any mission make sure to add the scripts folder with its contents to the mission folder, along with adding the contents of the initPlayerLocal.sqf script to the corresponding script in the mission folder.

It is possible to convert ACRE_RadioSettingsSaveAndRestore into a mod, useful if we want to add it to AF:UK. Dependencies are ACE and ACRE2.

=== This is now ready for BETA Testing ===
