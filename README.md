# ACRE_RadioSettingsSaveAndRestore
ACE Self Interaction script to Save and Restore ACRE2 Radio Settings between sessions.

This mission is using the Virtual Reality map.

You can access the fuctions via ACE Self Interaction -> Radios -> Radio Settings. Instructions are found there as well.
Everything has pretty much been implemented except for the last hard part: Restoring The Radio Settings to a set of new radios. Use scripts/restoreRadioSettings.sqf for this purpose.
