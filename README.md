# ACRE_RadioSettingsSaveAndRestore
ARMA3 - ACE Self Interaction scripts to Save and Restore ACRE2 Radio Settings between sessions.
(This mission is using the Virtual Reality map.)

You can access the fuctions via ACE Self Interaction -> Radios -> Radio Settings. Instructions are found there as well.

Everything has pretty much been implemented except for the last hard part: Restoring The Radio Settings to a set of new radios. Use scripts/restoreRadioSettings.sqf for this purpose.

The Delete Radio Settings function is only present for development purposes and will be removed when this is published. It does not serve any user purpose.
